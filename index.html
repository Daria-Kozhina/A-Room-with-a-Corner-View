	<p class="intro"> <i>A Room with A Corner View</i> is an investigation into the meaning of a corner beyond its archetypical shape in the context of punishment and guilt. It is an anatomy of the unknown within the intermediary realm of grim charm where reality meets the conceiving rumbles of entities.</p>
